2. [sprite-icon-32.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creesch/FlatBlue-css-theme-for-reddit/master/sprite-icon-32.png)


Go to /r/<yoursubreddit>/about/stylesheet 

You'll find one text area where you can paste the css and below that options for uploading the images. 

*Upload the sprite images before saving the css*

To tell RES that this style supports nightmode you'll have to add the following to your sidebar: 

    [](#/RES-nightModeCompatible)[](#/RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible) 

That's about it for a basic installation.
